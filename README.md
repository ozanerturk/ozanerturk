### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<p>

  I am a software developer working at <a href="https://sensemore.io">Sensemore</a> We are developing an IoT-based Predictive maintenance platform. We are trying to forecast failures, predict failure types, generate dynamic solitions, notify endusers, report detailed results, by monitoring health metrics of machines. I am responsible for developing and maintaining our cloud platform, which journey starts when a data package comes from end nodes to our various endpoints.
